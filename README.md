I participated in the AWS Ascend Zalestra ML Challenge and ranked 130th out of 1100 teams. I worked on predicting performance degradation in solar panels using sensor data. I cleaned the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical columns like error_code and installation_type, and scaling numerical features. I engineered features such as the difference between ambient and module temperatures to improve predictions. I trained a CatBoost regression model, which handled categorical features effectively and achieved a strong score on the test data. The final notebook in this repository includes the complete pipeline from preprocessing to generating predictions.
